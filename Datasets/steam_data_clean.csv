Will my mods still work when Terraria 1.4 is released?</strong><br>When the Terraria 1.4 update happens, your current Terraria install will automatically update to 1.4, thereby making any current non-Steam tModLoader install unable to load due to these version differences. <br><br>To fix this, simply install tModLoader via Steam!  tModLoader on Steam is installed independently from Terraria, with a separate entry in your Steam library, allowing you to switch between Terraria and tModLoader just by launching the version of the game you wish to play. Your mods, players, and worlds will all still be there.<br><br><strong>Does this mean tModLoader has updated to 1.4?</strong><br>No, that is still to come. tModLoader on Steam means tModLoader (on 1.3.5) and Terraria (on 1.4) will coexist without any effort from the user.<br><br><strong>I currently use tModLoader 64 bit, how will that work?</strong><br>tModLoader on Steam is launching with the 32 bit version of the application.  We are still discussing potential ways to bring 64 bit along perhaps sometime in the future.. At the very least, you'll should be able to manually install 64 bit over regular tModLoader as you have up until now. (It'll just be in the tModLoader folder now, instead of Terraria)<br><br><strong>What about Steam workshop support?</strong><br>Steam Workshop is planned, but won't be part of the initial release.","Dig, Fight, and Build your way through the world of player-created mods on Terraria with tModLoader - this DLC makes modding Terraria a reality!<br><br>tModLoader (TML) is an open-source, community-driven modification and expansion of the Terraria game that makes it possible to make and play mods.

Our wiki is filled with guides that learn you how to mod using tModLoader.<br><br>---<br><br><strong><u><h2 class=""bb_tag"">FAQ</h2></u></strong><br>Here are some important things to know when you Install and get ready to dive into tModLoader:<br><br><strong><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>You do not have to make any backups<br></li><li>Simply update Terraria to 1.4 and install tModLoader on Steam<br></li><li>You can play vanilla Terraria 1.4 and TML 1.3.5 alongside each other; tModLoader through Steam is treated as a separate game.<br></li><li>tModLoader for the 1.4 version of the game will come at a later date.<br></li><li>Steam Workshop is not supported as of yet, but is planned.<br></li><li>The Mod Browser will exist just as it is now, and we will not force Steam Workshop use<br></li><li>You can still use the 64 bit variant of tModLoader, but only as a separate installation <br></li><li>With the new release, tModLoader can be installed anywhere regardless of location or whether it is a Steam install.<br></li><li>tModLoader will work for Windows, Mac and Linux</li></ul></strong><br><br><strong>How will this affect me? Will my mods still work when Terraria 1.4 is released?</strong><br>When the Terraria 1.4 update happens, your current Terraria install will automatically update to 1.4, thereby making any current non-Steam tModLoader install unable to load due to these version differences. <br><br>To fix this, simply install tModLoader via Steam!  tModLoader on Steam is installed independently from Terraria, with a separate entry in your Steam library, allowing you to switch between Terraria and tModLoader just by launching the version of the game you wish to play. Your mods, players, and worlds will all still be there.<br><br><strong>Does this mean tModLoader has updated to 1.4?</strong><br>No, that is still to come. tModLoader on Steam means tModLoader (on 1.3.5) and Terraria (on 1.4) will coexist without any effort from the user.<br><br><strong>I currently use tModLoader 64 bit, how will that work?</strong><br>tModLoader on Steam is launching with the 32 bit version of the application.  We are still discussing potential ways to bring 64 bit along perhaps sometime in the future.. At the very least, you'll should be able to manually install 64 bit over regular tModLoader as you have up until now. (It'll just be in the tModLoader folder now, instead of Terraria)<br><br><strong>What about Steam workshop support?</strong><br>Steam Workshop is planned, but won't be part of the initial release.","Dig, Fight, and Build your way through the world of player-created mods on Terraria with tModLoader - this DLC makes modding Terraria a

SCP: Secret Laboratory,700330,0,,"Amidst the chaos of a disastrous mass containment failure at the supposed “master site” Site-02, you fight your way to the top alongside — and against — other players. From devious D-Class and cunning scientists to elite Mobile Task Force units (MTF), rebellious Chaos Insurgency (CI), and even the horrific SCP Entities, there are many key roles to play in this gruesome affair, so... <strong><i>How will you act amidst a containment breach?</i></strong><br><br><i>SCP: Secret Laboratory (SCP: SL)</i> is a free-to-play multiplayer horror game heavily based on the SCP Foundation series and its expanded universe of monsters and paranormal phenomena. The primary objective of the SCP Foundation (also “the Foundation”) is to safeguard the world from any and all entities, objects, or phenomena that are deemed potential threats to humanity, and thus to uphold the normalcy of the modern world.

Shadowverse CCG,453480,0,,"Four million battles every day. One Shadowverse. Japan's #1 strategic card game.<br />
Made by card gamers for card gamers. <br />
<br />
Shadowverse is Japan's #1 strategic card game!<br />
- There are millions of Shadowverse battles every day, and a multitude of ways to play<br />
- Easy to get into, thanks to a singleplayer story mode, free card packs for new players, and bonuses every day <br />
- Battles are finely balanced, with less RNG than other card games, and balance adjustments take place every month<br />
- New card expansions are released every three months, unleashing new deck-building strategies and battle tactics<br />
- We’ve got a great community of 22 million players and counting, with tournaments and esports broadcasts every week and support for streamers <br />
- Featuring beautiful art and animations and fully voiced cards and story<br />
<br />
<br />
- A multitude of ways to play: <br />
With eight different leader classes, Shadowverse gives you unparalleled freedom to create your own deck strategies. Will you play as Urias and unleash your Vengeance when your health is depleted? Or will you select Isabelle, whose spells power up the cards in your hand? Will you go all in with an aggro deck, or try to contain the board with a control deck? Or will you try to sneak in some sublimely ingenious combos? It’s entirely up to you. <br />
<br />
- Easy to get into: <br />
Learn the basics by playing through our extensive singleplayer story mode before taking on other players in our multiplayer modes. Be sure to pick up your free card packs after you’ve finished playing through the tutorial – just go to your Crate from the main menu to pick them up. And bonuses and daily missions help you unlock new card packs every day so it won’t be long before you have a deck that is capable of competing with the very best. <br />
<br />
- Finely balanced: <br />
There’s less RNG in Shadowverse than other card games, making it supremely balanced: you’ll need to trust your judgement not your luck if you are to come out on top. And we make balance adjustments every month to make sure that no one card or deck type becomes too dominant.<br />
<br />
- New card expansions released regularly: <br />
New card expansions are added every three months to make sure the meta never gets stale. And every single expansion unleashes new deck-building strategies and battle tactics, and even new leader classes and game modes. We’re in this for the long haul and we hope you will be too.<br />
<br />
- Beautiful art:<br />
All of the cards in Shadowverse feature fantastic art by some of Japan’s finest artists, and every single card is available as an animated version. Every card is also fully-voiced, in English and Japanese, as is the singleplayer storyline. <br />
<br />
- A great community:<br />
And last but not least, we have some amazing fans. We’ve got memes, we’ve got streams, and we have much, much more to offer than the average card game. Community tournaments and e-sports broadcasts take place every week, and there are a ton of deck-building resources online in case you get stuck. Millions of card gamers can’t be wrong – why don’t you join them?","Four million battles every day. One Shadowverse. Japan's #1 strategic card game.<br />

- Featuring beautiful art and animations and fully voiced cards and story<br />
<br />
<br />
- A multitude of ways to play: <br />
With eight different leader classes, Shadowverse gives you unparalleled freedom to create your own deck strategies. Will you play as Urias and unleash your Vengeance when your health is depleted? Or will you select Isabelle, whose spells power up the cards in your hand? Will you go all in with an aggro deck, or try to contain the board with a control deck? Or will you try to sneak in some sublimely ingenious combos? It’s entirely up to you. <br />
<br />
- Easy to get into: <br />
Learn the basics by playing through our extensive singleplayer story mode before taking on other players in our multiplayer modes. Be sure to pick up your free card packs after you’ve finished playing through the tutorial – just go to your Crate from the main menu to pick them up. And bonuses and daily missions help you unlock new card packs every day so it won’t be long before you have a deck that is capable of competing with the very best. <br />
<br />
- Finely balanced: <br />
There’s less RNG in Shadowverse than other card games, making it supremely balanced: you’ll need to trust your judgement not your luck if you are to come out on top. And we make balance adjustments every month to make sure that no one card or deck type becomes too dominant.<br />
<br />
- New card expansions released regularly: <br />
New card expansions are added every three months to make sure the meta never gets stale. And every single expansion unleashes new deck-building strategies and battle tactics, and even new leader classes and game modes. We’re in this for the long haul and we hope you will be too.<br />
<br />
- Beautiful art:<br />
All of the cards in Shadowverse feature fantastic art by some of Japan’s finest artists, and every single card is available as an animated version. Every card is also fully-voiced, in English and Japanese, as is the singleplayer storyline. <br />
<br />
- A great community:<br />
And last but not least, we have some amazing fans. We’ve got memes, we’ve got streams, and we have much, much more to offer than the average card game. Community tournaments and e-sports broadcasts take place every week, and there are a ton of deck-building resources online in case you get stuck. Millions of card gamers can’t be wrong – why don’t you join them?",Four million battles every day. One Shadowverse. Japan's #1 strategic card game. Made by card gamers for card gamers. ,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/453480/header.jpg?t=1621924768,https://shadowverse.com/,"{'minimum': '<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 8.1/10 (64-bit)<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Core i3-3225/AMD A8-7650K<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> GeForce GT 640/Radeon HD 5770<br></li><li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 11<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 8.5 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Resolution: 1024×768</li></ul>'}","{'minimum': '<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>OS:</strong> OS X 10.11<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce 320M<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 8.5 GB available space<br></li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> Resolution: 1024×768</li></ul>'}",[],"© Cygames, Inc.",windows;mac,,Single-player;Multi-player;PvP;Online PvP;Cross-Platform Multiplayer;In-App Purchases,Free to Play;Strategy,"[{'id': 0, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/453480/ss_4a3733b469b5822a324ab0545349ea4d45ddcc97.600x338.jpg?t=1621924768', 'path_full': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/453480/ss_4a3733b469b5822a324ab0545349ea4d45ddcc97.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621924768'}, {'id': 1, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/453480/ss_0ee5e5c2123d1c4f9fe7215ef1adfde43defc0ff.600x338.jpg?t=1621924768', 'path_full': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/453480/ss_0ee5e5c2123d1c4f9fe7215ef1adfde43defc0ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621924768'}, {'id': 2, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/453480/ss_8153cba0cc8e8361e3f6e293ed546eafbd6fa27a.600x338.jpg?t=1621924768', 'path_full': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/453480/ss_8153cba0cc8e8361e3f6e293ed546eafbd6fa27a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621924768'}, {'id': 3, 'path_thumbnail': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/453480/ss_864fa66764c178e74e476bc130d6d7dc50a7054f.600x338.jpg?t=1621924768', 'path_full': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/453480/ss_864fa66764c178e74e476bc130d6d7dc50a7054f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1621924768'}]","[{'id': 256832817, 'name': 'Shadowverse trailer EN 20210430', 'thumbnail': 'https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256832817/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1621588761', 'webm': {'480': 'http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256832817/movie480_vp9.webm?t=1621588761', 'max': 'http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256832817/movie_max_vp9.webm?t=1621588761'}, 'mp4': {'480': 'http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256832817/movie480.mp4?t=1621588761', 'max': 'http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256832817/movie_max.mp4?t=1621588761'}, 'highlight': True}]",{'total': 368},0,"{'coming_soon': False, 'date': 'Oct 27, 2016'}","{'url': 'https://shadowverse.com/', 'email': ''}",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/453480/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1621924768,0.0,1,"Cygames, Inc.","Cygames, Inc.;Cygames Korea Inc."

In the 31st century the battlefields are dominated by immense and powerful mechanized units called BattleMechs. Join the ranks of elite operators tasked with piloting these war machines. Choose your path to becoming the most feared MechWarrior in the Inner Sphere, fighting for battlefield supremacy against other players.<br><br>Enter the Solaris Arena.<br><br>The newest addition to MechWarrior online™, Solaris 7, features 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2 Mech Combat across 7 Divisions. Choose your BattleMech wisely, each of the 7 Divisions has a limited roster of BattleMechs available based on the Mech’s performance capabilities on the battlefield. Take a Patron Contract, pick up sponsors, and earn accolades as you climb to the top of the Divisions Leaderboards. Solaris 7 features 5 maps tailored for intense Mech Combat.<br><br>Quick Play is where you'll find fast action, fielding a single 'Mech in team-based game modes and maps. Unlike Faction Play, Quick Play matches do not influence the layout of Inner Sphere territories; these battles are fought purely for rewards and glory.<br><br>In Faction Play you will field 4 ‘Mechs per match, lending your skills and allegiance to the Faction of your choosing in prolonged team-based engagements, conquering and defending planets in their name to earn rewards and expand your Faction's territory across the Inner Sphere.<br><br><strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Gameplay </h2></strong><br>Piloting a 'Mech to victory requires a mastery of tactical positioning, teamwork, and firing discipline. Strike out as a Lone Wolf or seek out one of the many player-controlled Units and fight under the banners of powerful galactic empires for prestige, wealth, or nothing more than the sheer thrill of battle. <br><br><strong>Next Gen Mobility </strong> - By the 31st century, tanks have evolved to take on humanoid shape, their treads replaced with nimble legs. Like modern tanks, 'Mechs move their upper torso and weapons independently of their legs offering unparalleled mobility while exchanging fire. Depending on their size, BattleMechs travel at vastly different speeds and offer different systems like jump jets to aid in their locomotion.<br><br><strong>Make Every Shot Count </strong> - Pilots must balance mobility and damage output against the amount of heat generated from their weapons fire and 'Mech operation, lest they risk the temporary loss of power that comes when a 'Mech overheats. Firing all weapons simultaneously (known as an Alpha Strike) can be the quickest way to devastate an opponent, but may leave a 'Mech helpless against its enemies if the heat sinks can't handle the stress.<br><br><strong>Fight Smart </strong> - 'Mechs possess both external armor and strong internal structural elements to help minimize the chance of a 'quick kill'. As a result, pilots must treat each encounter with the utmost attention and awareness, prioritizing weaker or more critical components before delivering the killing blow. Communication among teammates and the effective use of targeting systems can help to identify vulnerable 'Mechs and components.<br><br><strong>Teamwork is the Difference </strong> - Targeting a 'Mech will automatically allow your teammates to achieve their own lock, allowing them to ascertain vital location data, armor status, and loadout details for the targeted enemy. Information Warfare can be a vital component for victory, providing attack-focused allies with the necessary information to tear their opponents to pieces.<br><br><strong>Information Warfare</strong> - While fast-moving scouts feed target and tactical information back to the main battle group and the team commander, long-range Support and heavy-hitting Brawler and Assault ‘Mechs will use this information to position themselves for the perfect strike. Pilots can also shield themselves and allies from enemy sensors and weapons fire using various counter measures. It is up to each pilot to customize their BattleMech loadout to fulfill their desired role. <br><br><strong>Find the perfect 'Mech </strong>- Hundreds of unique 'Mechs are available, offering a wide range of strengths and weaknesses. Smaller 'Mechs should never stop moving, and can rely on their sheer speed to overwhelm heavier opponents. Larger 'Mechs move slow and deliberate but can stand toe-to-toe with other large opponents. Acquire and test different 'Mechs to find those that best suit your play style.<br><br><strong>Choose Your Allegiance </strong> - Work for the powerful empires of the galaxy to earn their loyalty and spread their influence across the stars. Band together with other pilots using the Looking For Group feature, or use the Faction Chat feature to coordinate offensive and defensive strategies to capture or defend worlds and shift the balance of power.<br><br><strong>Get Rewarded </strong> - Pilots earn ComStar Bills (C-Bills) from playing matches and completing faction contracts, which can be used to purchase new 'Mechs and equipment.<br><br>Certain items can only be purchased using premium 'Mech Credits (MC). MC can either be purchased directly via real world money or acquired in smaller increments in-game by earning reputation with a Faction in Faction Play, or as rewards from participating in special Events.<br><br>'Mech Experience (XP) gained during combat is applied to the 'Mech used during that match, and can be used to unlock improvements to various BattleMech systems.<br><br>MechWarrior Online™ also includes a host of achievements to unlock that will challenge even the most skilled players.","<strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">MechWarrior Online™ Solaris 7</h2></strong><br><br>MechWarrior Online™ Solaris 7 is a tactical, 'Mech-based online shooter set in the vast BattleTech Universe.

Dirty Bomb®,333930,0,,"<h1>Update Notes</h1><p>Welcome to another Dirty Bomb update. In this one we're making a number of big changes and it's time for another make-over for Proxy.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">FRAGMENT CASE UPDATE</h2><br>Long story short, Fragment Cases will no longer drop after you complete matches.<br><br>Short story long, we know that many of you find the Fragment cases a little underwhelming when you earn them and they're added to your inventory, so we thought of a better way for you to earn Fragments in a bit of a more interesting way (Read the next section to find out what)<br><br>Psst. If you have any Fragment Cases in your inventory, don't worry! Those won't be going anywhere, so you can save them for the memories or open them at your leisure.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">INCREASED LOADOUT CASE DROP RATES</h2><br>Enter the replacement for Fragment Cases! We've more than DOUBLED the drop rate of Loadout Cases at the end of matches so your Loadout Card earn rate will increase significantly. But how does this give you more Fragments? Well, if you decide to Recycle the cards you get from these cases you'll be earning a little more Fragments on average over time than you were before.<br><br>With this update we've also added your Fragment balance to the front-end menu so you always know how many you have. This should also help new and existing players get to know the Crafting system a bit more, making it easier to interact with and giving it more visibility.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">OBSIDIAN OPERATIVE PROXY</h2><br>Skydaddy brought home the bacon in the last update with his epic Obsidian overhaul, but now it's Proxy's turn to bring home a bigger piece of bacon (and hopefully a better metaphor).<br><br>When trying to describe this Obsidian it's difficult to not use words like &quot;f*****g awesome&quot;, &quot;holy s**t&quot; and &quot;very nice&quot;. But don't take it from me, check it out in game!<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/333930/extras/Proxy-OBOPs-Social_800x450.jpg?t=1591272761"" /><br><br>*drops mic*<h2 class=""bb_tag"">BUG FIXES</h2><br><strong>General</strong><br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Fixed issue where the individual Merc drop-down filter did not show any Merc Decks<br></li><li>Improved attacking hitbox of the Ulu<br></li><li>Fixed issue where the Founder's Fragger model would incorrectly load at a certain distance</li></ul><br>Want to chat about it some more?

Just an ordinary young man with thousands, even hundreds of thousands of those like him in every ordinary city.

In front of him is &quot;Sovyonok&quot; - a pioneer camp, behind him is his former life. To understand what happened to him, Semyon will have to get to know the local inhabitants (and maybe even find love), find his way in the complex labyrinth of human relationships and his own problems and solve the camp's mysteries.

Immerse yourselves in the atmosphere of a dynamic action movie with themed content! It features heaps of season-specific novelties such as a new Special Operation, a map for the &quot;Blitz&quot; mode, a Battle Pass, the shotgun Kalashnikov USA Komrad 12 and the sniper rifle M4 Marksman Custom, weapon series and much more, as well as unseasonal content: a powerful rifle АК-15 Custom and the &quot;Lucky Rabbit&quot; series.<br><br>In the new special operation, you’ll have to pull off a full-blown bank robbery and destroy data that mustn’t fall into the hands of General Lee Wharton. &quot;Heist&quot; is a mission for two partners, who with the help of new cable mechanics will move along the bank building, open three storage facilities with increasing levels of difficulty, while simultaneously fighting the police and special forces and, of course, immerse themselves in the atmosphere of a dynamic action-packed thriller.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291480/extras/bank.gif?t=1617368851"" /><br><br>The model is a semi-automatic weapon that is capable of destroying the enemy with two impacts at any distance. It favourably compares to its closest competitors (the rifles H&amp;K G28 and Cobalt Kinetics Twenty-Seven) thanks to an increased damage and better rate of fire offset by a less spacious magazine and more modest ammo. The arm comes equipped with 5 unique attachments: a flame suppressor, two handles, a collimator sight and a regular sight.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291480/extras/laser.gif?t=1617368851"" /><br><br>New weapon series: &quot;The Big Score&quot;, &quot;Mechanical&quot;, &quot;Heat&quot; and &quot;Lucky Rabbit&quot;, the looks of these models will certainly show others your uniqueness - just look at the weapon frames and enjoy the detailed cutscenes. The guns also have other distinctive features, which will appeal to those who like to shoot from eye-catching weapons!<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291480/extras/rope.gif?t=1617368851"" /><br><br>The Kalashnikov USA Komrad 12 is an automatic shotgun boasting excellent specs. It favourably compares to its main competitors Uzkon UNG-12 and Typhoon F12 thanks to increased damage, great firing range and impressive hip fire accuracy, which are offset by an average rate of fire and modest ammo.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291480/extras/shoot.gif?t=1617368851"" /><br><br>&quot;Shapeshifter&quot; gear is equipment for hired robbers. It is essential for them to have good protection from bullets in shootouts with the police. The new gear has the best direct armour protection (more armour points for vests, and more damage absorption points for every shot); however, it is less appealing in all other respects since it features lower movement speed values, reduced number of secondary bonuses (for example, bonuses to recoil, spread and reload), and moderate health restoration, as well as a complete lack of armour replenishment.<br><br>In addition, due to the special distribution of armour points among the class vests of the set, it was possible to achieve an increase in the efficiency and value of the Rifleman on the battlefield - this class received the highest number of armour points. With the new armour, the Rifleman will be able to survive longer and gain precious seconds to complete the battle in his or her favor!<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291480/extras/vault.gif?t=1617368851"" /><br><br>The assault rifle AK-15 is designed as an impressive modified version of the real prototype (hence the word Custom in the name) with a lot of attachments. The AK-15 Custom offers all the perks of its main competitors, but inflicts more damage due to its larger caliber.

Planet Explorers,237870,0,[553700],"In Planet Explorers, it is the year 2287, one of the first colony ships sent out by Earth arrives at the planet Maria, in the Epsilon Indi Star System. During its landing sequence, something appears in front of the massive ship that causes it to lose control and crash into the planet. Some of the colonists survive in lifeboats, but what they find is an unforgiving land filled with creatures ready to outlast the visitors from Earth. Now the survivors must explorer, gather, build, create, fight, and ultimately, build a new home.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Game Modes</strong></h2><br>Planet Explorers right now only features single player. <br><br>In single player there are 3 distinct selections <br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Story Mode</strong> – Story mode is the main meat and bones of the game, it is the action-adventure-rpg-somewhat-4X segment, offering npcs, missions, colony building, farming, training, diplomacy, and of course, a storyline that you can follow or ignore. This story features a 17X8km world map with many unique character, landscapes, biomes, locations, and over 140 types of potential enemies. Even though we’ve made it seem like a very action oriented game in the trailers, in reality, players can choose to not fight so much as to just plant a farm, make some food, keep the colonists alive, negotiate with the sentient aliens, and defend the perimeter from the local life forms.

During its landing sequence, something appears in front of the massive ship that causes it to lose control and crash into the planet. Some of the colonists survive in lifeboats, but what they find is an unforgiving land filled with creatures ready to outlast the visitors from Earth. Now the survivors must explorer, gather, build, create, fight, and ultimately, build a new home.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Game Modes</strong></h2><br>Planet Explorers right now only features single player. <br><br>In single player there are 3 distinct selections <br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Story Mode</strong> – Story mode is the main meat and bones of the game, it is the action-adventure-rpg-somewhat-4X segment, offering npcs, missions, colony building, farming, training, diplomacy, and of course, a storyline that you can follow or ignore. This story features a 17X8km world map with many unique character, landscapes, biomes, locations, and over 140 types of potential enemies. Even though we’ve made it seem like a very action oriented game in the trailers, in reality, players can choose to not fight so much as to just plant a farm, make some food, keep the colonists alive, negotiate with the sentient aliens, and defend the perimeter from the local life forms. That can still eventually arrive at the ending. And yes, there is an ending.

Taking inspiration from George Romero's &quot;Of the Dead&quot; series, the mod is set during a time in which the world is on the verge of collapsing into chaos from a disease whose origin is unknown. Many experts and organizations have their theories and ideas on how such a disease emerged and started to systematically destroy our very way of life, but one fact is clear to all. Whoever perishes from the disease gets up and kills, and the people they killed get up and kill.<br><br>The chances of you surviving this all out war of society and the undead are slim to none. Already, there are millions of the walking dead shambling about, searching for food to eat. There's no known cure. One bite can possibly end it all for you. However, you aren't alone in this nightmare. There are still a handful of uninfected survivors left in this god forsaken hellhole, and with co-operation and teamwork, you may live long enough to fight your way to salvation.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Features:</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Co-operative play with up to eight players.<br></li><li><strong>Voice and Text Communications Limited by Distance:</strong> The further you're away the harder it is for other players to hear you.

Cry of Fear,223710,0,,"<p>Cry of Fear is a psychological single-player and co-op horror game set in a deserted town filled with horrific creatures and nightmarish delusions.

PlanetSide 2,218230,0,,"<h1>ESCALATION UPDATE</h1><p><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>NEW WAR ASSETS</strong></h2><br>Incoming Alert, soldier...an omega level threat looms over the horizon...<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2-Bastion.jpg?t=1602861166"" /> <br><br>Dedicated Outfits can now accrue new resources by collectively capturing or defending bases across Auraxis, which can be crafted into powerful new War Assets and deployed across the battlefield!<br><br>Examples of new craftable Assets include:<br><br><strong>The Bastion Fleet Carrier</strong><br><br>This mighty leviathan of the skies has no rival on the battlefield! The Bastion is the ultimate force multiplier, capable of providing long-range air and ground support with mannable turrets, ship-mounted artillery cannons, an interceptor launch platform, and mobile respawn point for your entire Outfit. Bastions require significant resources to deploy, and even greater coordination and collective will power to bring down! <br><br><strong>Citadel Shield</strong><br><br>This massive, projective-blocking bubble shield can now protect entire bases from airborne and long-range threats! Roughly the size of a small outpost, the Citadel Shield provides a sturdy line of defense for protecting any strategic objective.  <br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2-CitadelShield.jpg?t=1602861166"" /> <br><br><strong>Steel Rain</strong><br><br>Squad and Platoon Leaders can now deploy an organized platoon drop pod assault to take your foes by surprise! After a short countdown, squadmates will be redeployed into drop pods above your target area, allowing you to crack a rival Empire’s stubborn base defense, or move quickly across the map and respond to an incoming threat.<br><br><strong>A.N.V.I.L.</strong><br><br>Use the Advanced Nanite Vehicle Insertion Logistics system to airdrop a ground vehicle of your choice on demand! Like Steel Rain, the A.N.V.I.L. drop location can be set via waypoint, perfect for reinforcing a defensive push, or mobilizing an offensive force.  <br><br><strong>Orbital Satellite Uplink</strong><br><br>Outfits now have the ability to call in an Orbital Strike on any target location! Use it to deter an enemy's advancing armor column, or clear that dug-in mountaintop.<br><br>All War Assets take time and resources to craft, and Outfit leaders will have the ability to grant privileges to other Outfit members to craft and/or deploy these Assets to help turn the tides of battle. For more intel on War Assets, head over to our War Assets Guide.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>OUTFIT WARS: A NEW COMPETITIVE ENDGAME</strong></h2><br>Outfit Wars is a new tournament structure for competitive Outfits in PlanetSide 2. Outfits from every Empire and server region now have the opportunity to opt-in to a monthly Qualification cycle, before squaring off in epic GvGvG battles on Desolation, an all-new Asteroid continent built for competitive play. Outfits qualify for Outfit Wars by accruing resources in the main game, with the top Outfits from each region earning the right to represent their Empire on the field of glory.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2-Desolation.jpg?t=1602861166"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>SANCTUARY</strong></h2><br>This update also brings the debut of Sanctuary, a new social hub for players of all Empires. Initially, Sanctuary will serve as a recruitment area for Outfit leaders, a trading space for new vendor NPCs, and a low-key relaxation zone for the war-weary. Sanctuary launches with the spacious Atrium area, as well as the Central Operations area. This environment will continue to expand as an in-game community space, and act as a foundation for future functionality.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2-Sanctuary.jpg?t=1602861166"" /><br><br>Share your favorite moments from the Escalation update with us on <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.facebook.com/planetside2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""  >Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://www.twitter.com/planetside2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer""  >Twitter</a>, or our <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://forums.daybreakgames.com/ps2/index.php"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""  >Forums!</a></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/218230/extras/PS2-Logo-Hztl.png?t=1602861166"" /> <br><br><strong>PlanetSide 2</strong> is a free-to-play, massively multiplayer online first person shooter (MMOFPS).  <br><br>Empires and their soldiers battle in an all-out planetary war on a scale never before seen, in stunning, breathtaking detail.

As he deals these mighty blows, he gains the ability to unleash devastating counters.<br>His disciplined yet relentless assault through myriad multi-hit attacks and practiced parries makes him a balanced fighter no matter the challenge.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">One Who Fights for Justice</h2>Blessed with good fortune, beauty, intelligence, and skill in battle, Kael was the adored son of a count who had also won the king's favor early on.

One more thing to remember.  Always watch your surroundings when you play in a map as you may get hit by a train, or lose a step and fall off the bridge.  More game modes will be added in the future so please stay tuned.<br><br><u><strong>Capture the Base</strong></u><br>Work as a team and defeat the opposing side by capturing the bases scattered around in the map.  Protect your bases or teammates when they’re capturing.  Be on the lookout as you are capturing, there may be someone to interrupt you right at the end.<br><br><u><strong>Team Last Man Standing</strong></u><br>The team with the most round wins will prevail.  Be careful as there are no respawns during rounds.  There’s nothing like being the last survivor and deliver a win for your teammates at the end while they’re all watching you.<br><br><u><strong>Free for All</strong></u><br>No more friendship, just killing.  Are you the type that prefers being a lone wolf?  This is just for you. The rule is simple.  The one who gets the most kills wins the match.  Careful though as there are wolves lurking in the shadow ready to steal your kill.<br><br><u><strong>Team Deathmatch</strong></u><br>A team with more kills wins the match. To get a kill is the biggest contribution you can make to your team here.  Be a support or that guy who’s always at the very front of battle.  Whatever gets kills is good for the team.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/207230/extras/ArcheBlade_Official_04_Seeya.jpg?t=1447355405"" />",ArcheBlade is a free to play 3D multiplayer fighting game that captures the essence of combo-based fighting games combined with unique game modes.

Petty lords vie against beleaguered kings who struggle to assert control over their fragmented realms. The Pope calls for a Crusade to protect the Christians in the Holy Land even as he refuses to relinquish control over the investiture of bishops - and their riches. Now is the time for greatness. Expand your demesne and secure the future of your dynasty. Fill your coffers, appoint vassals, root out traitors and heretics, introduce laws and interact with hundreds of nobles, each with their own agenda.<br>						 A good lord will always need friends to support him.
